# Summary: 

# A large majority of the global workforce faces troubles commuting to their jobs, and collectively, hundreds of thousands of hours of potential productivity are wasted sitting in traffic. In an effort to streamline this process, the Electric Rail System (ERS) concept was developed. Conventional methods of travel such as cars are inefficient, slow, and become major sources of pollution in large urban environments. Moreover, cars are one of the leading causes of fatalities in the world. The ERS is targeted to address these issues. 
  
# The ERS enables travel for both inter and intra city commuters in a way that is safe, fast, and energy-efficient. Although methods of commuting such as bikes and buses also exist as the main competitors, each has drawbacks that the ERS overcomes. Bikes are unable to cover long distances in a timely manner and are not feasible options during the winter, and buses still have to contend with traffic while running on natural gases, a nonrenewable energy source. The ERS is able to cover long distances, going between cities while also maintaining rail lines within them. The ERS also runs on electricity, with solar panels on the top allowing the batteries to recharge during the day. The ERS is based on a rail system, meaning traffic is not a factor as well. The major competitors to the ERS system would be Hyperloop and subways. Both aim to expedite travel. While subways have the advantage of being more maneuverable, and the Hyperloop is much faster than the ERS, the cost to maintain and construct the infrastructure for both is much greater than the ERS, leaving the ERS as a cheaper alternative. The assembly of the monorail system is much cheaper than excavating tunnels for a subway or producing the airtight chambers necessary for the Hyperloop to function.
  
# In order to develop the ERS design, multiple phases of design and testing will be performed until the optimal standards for safety, efficiency, and emissions are met. Technical devices such as tilt-sensors will be used to carry out these tests.
